INFO
====
RoundhousE is an automated database deployment (change management) system that allows you to use your current idioms and gain much more. Currently it only supports Microsoft SQL Server, but there are future plans for other databases. 

It seeks to solve both maintenance concerns and ease of deployment. We follow some of the same idioms as other database management systems (SQL scripts), but we are different in that we think about future maintenance concerns. We want to always apply certain scripts (anything stateless like functions, views, stored procedures, and permissions), so we don’t have to throw everything into our change scripts. This seeks to solves future source control concerns. How sweet is it when you can version the database according to your current source control version? 

============
REQUIREMENTS
============
* .NET Framework 3.5 
* SQL Server 2005/2008 installed (or required DLLS in the GAC for SQL Server 2005/2008)
* SA access to the sql server (for creation or deletion)
* change access to the database (for everything else)

* Restore timeouts can now be specified (with a default timeout of 900 seconds) - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=21 for details. (r117)
* Custom database create scripts are now possible - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=20 for details. (r116)
* All types of migrations will split sql statements from files that have more than one statement into multiple statements and run each consecutively - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=17 for details. (r113)
* Fixed issue with running roundhouse twice during MSBuild - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=16 for details. (r112)

=0.2.0.108=
* Reports version during run - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=9 for details. (r108)
* Logs what type of script it is looking for and where it is looking for them - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=14 for details. (r107)
* Removed double error reporting on exception. (r107)
* Adding getting started documentation
* Added a custom restore option to add additional arguments (like MOVE) to a restore - see (http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=12 for details. (r104)
* Fixed a connection string initialization issue (r103)

=0.2.0.101=
* File Sorting - Fixed a sorting issue with file names to do explicit sorting. (r101)
* RH has an icon of the logo (r99)

=0.2.0.97=
* OleDB Support - RH can now be run for advanced database connections with a connection string. (r96)
  - OleDB may not support creating/restoring/deleting databases.
  - Microsoft Access is supported through OleDB.
  - Other databases will need to have scripts written for their type before they would be supported.

=0.0.0.86=
* Environment awareness - RH determines an environment file first that it has ".ENV." in the file name and then if it is the proper environment file based on whether the file also contains the specific environment name. For example LOCAL.0001_DoSomething.ENV.sql will run in the LOCAL environment but no where else.
* Runs permissions files every time regardless of changes.

=0.0.0.85=
* Added synonyms for database types - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=10 for details. (r85)
* Removed some of the logging - no more event logging for limited permissions running (r83)

=0.0.0.82=
* The command line version (rh.exe) is merged into a single assembly with all dependencies (except Microsoft.SQL dlls) internalized. No configuration file necessary either. (r77, r82)
* Log from console runner is now copied into the change_drop folder. (r81)
* Recovery mode is now explicit. Default is full. Otherwise pass in /simple - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=8 for details. (r78) 
* Excluded the drop database from transactions (not that you would call /drop with /t). (r76)

=0.0.0.74=
* Fixed an issue with holding connections - see http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=7 for details. (r74)
* Added the ability to run with transactions
